Summary: Becoming a dad changed how I see time—and gave me a reason to finally dive deep into AI. This is the start of documenting that journey.

I’m 32, and I work in valuation and analytics. My career has always been about understanding how things create value. Over the past couple of years, it’s become clear that few things will reshape that equation more than artificial intelligence.

When ChatGPT was first released, I was finishing a *100 Days of Python* course. I wasn’t a developer by any stretch, but I’d learned just enough to tinker. Suddenly, this new tool made coding, automation, and problem-solving far more accessible. I started building small projects—nothing fancy, but enough to feel the momentum of what was coming.

So when my company introduced six months of paid paternity leave, I decided to use part of that time to dive deeper. I want to understand AI beyond the headlines: how large language models work, what “agentic AI” really means, and how these systems might transform the way we analyze, write, and make decisions.

There’s a practical motivation here too. My own industry—valuation and consulting—is full of structured data, long reports, and human judgment. It’s exactly the kind of work that AI will both challenge and enhance. I’d rather learn to ride the wave than be surprised by it.

This blog is simply a way to document that process. I’m not a computer scientist; I’m a chartered accountant learning in public. Some posts will be short reflections, others small experiments or tools. With a newborn at home, I won’t pretend there will be a schedule—but when I find something interesting, I’ll share it.

Mostly, I’m doing this to stay curious. Technology and fatherhood both remind you how much can change in a short time—and how worth it it is to keep learning.
